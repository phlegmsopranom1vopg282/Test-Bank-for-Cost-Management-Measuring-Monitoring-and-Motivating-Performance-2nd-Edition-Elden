  * Cost accounting has become an increasingly important tool for managers and accountants alike. The second edition helps them achieve professional success by bridging the gaps between knowledge, skills and abilities. It has been revised to focus on decision-making while still examining the procedural detail. It also emphasizes the analysis and application of concepts. Additional examples and illustrations draw comparisons between government and manufacturing. Real-world scenarios and ethical decision-making sections demonstrate how the material is applied. Accountants and managers will also view Excel spreadsheets to give them a better understanding of the material.
